# TODO

Add page for Ansible (1)
{ .annotate }

1. How Ansible is used for automation in the homelab, and what Ansible leaves to the admin.


Monitoring (1)
{ .annotate }

1. The choice of the monitoring tool (nagios), howto set it up, extend possibilities with nrpe and eventually beautification with grafana


LDAP (1)
{ .annotate }

1. Because I had a real hard time setting it up with Ansible (in multi-master replication), but also because LDAP is soo cool ^^
