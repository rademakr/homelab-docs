# TODO

Add page for Ansible (1)
{ .annotate }

1. How Ansible is used for automation in the homelab, and what Ansible leaves to the admin.


Monitoring (1)
{ .annotate }

1. The choice of the monitoring tool (nagios), howto set it up, extend possibilities with nrpe and eventually beautification with grafana

Docker (1)
{ .annotate }

1. We'll be using docker.io to setup Nextcloud. Might be a good time to check out portainer at the same time.

Nextcloud (1)
{ .annotate }

1. Not yet implemented, but soon ;-) Integration with Cloudflare. Crossing my fingers all goes according to plan, otherwise I'll opt to implement a R-Proxy solution.

LDAP (1)
{ .annotate }

1. Because I had a real hard time setting it up with Ansible (in multi-master replication), but also because LDAP is soo cool ^^
