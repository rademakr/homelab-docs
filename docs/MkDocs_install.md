# mkdocs

### Prerequisites

You'll need python & pip installed  
If you want seemless deployments to GitHub pages, you'll also need a GitHub account.

## Installation

First things first, create a new public repository in your GitHub space. I will call mine `homelab-docs`.  
Once that is done, you can clone the repo on your local server:

```
rademakr@prismpi[~]$ git clone git@github.com:rademakr/homelab-docs.git
```

That will create a new homelab-docs directory that is git and GitHub related.  
Now we can install mkdocs.


```
rademakr@prismpi[~/homelab-docs]$ python -m venv venv
rademakr@prismpi[~/homelab-docs]$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) rademakr@prismpi[~/homelab-docs]$ pip --version
pip 23.0.1 from /home/rademakr/homelab-docs/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pip (python 3.11)
(venv) rademakr@prismpi[~/homelab-docs]$ pip install mkdocs-material

```
This will install mkdocs-material.

We'll create our website with the following command:

`(venv) rademakr@prismpi[~/homelab-docs]$ mkdocs new .`

Which will create two files :

```
INFO    -  Writing config file: ./mkdocs.yml
INFO    -  Writing initial docs: ./docs/index.md
```

The `mkdocs.yml` file is where you'll set all the settings for the website, while the `Ã¬ndex.md` in the `docs` direcory is a markdown page
that will be the first tab of the homepage. We'll be able to remove that file later, or update it with the text you want...

The idea is to add one .md file per project. Thus I have this file named `mkdocs.md` for the instructions on setting up mkdocs.

I will add one for Ansible, and a few to describe specific middleware configuration.

## GitHub integration with GitHub-Actions

Create the `.github` directory and `workflows` subdirectory. In the `workflows` directory create a file `ci.yml`


```
mkdir -p .github/workflows
vi .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

and paste the following:

```yaml
name: ci
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main
permissions:
  contents: write
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.x
      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          key: ${{ github.ref }}
          path: .cache
      - run: pip install mkdocs-material
      - run: pip install pillow cairosvg
      - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

## TODO

git initialization (1)
{ .annotate }

1. need to explain how to setup the GitHub repo and init the git env
